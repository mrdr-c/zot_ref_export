# Zotero references script (and app)
This project aims to create a user-friendly interface that enables retreiving reference collections from Zotero and pasting them into a docx file.

## TODO
- [ ] Which kind of attachment to use? Potential candidates: `docx`, `md`, Zotero notes format (whatever that is...)
- [ ] How to deal with templates?
- [ ] Specify which information is relevant for references
